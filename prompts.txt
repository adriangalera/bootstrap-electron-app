I want to create an electron application to handle bank accounts. 

So far, let's create the first window. 

Each bank account must have a name and a provider (so far only one provider named kutxabank can be selected).

The first window must have a list of the created bank accounts and a button to create a new one. Each entry on the list must display the name, the provider and a button to delete the bank account.

Once the button to create a new one is clicked, a new modal should appear where it request the user to provide the bank account name and the provider
